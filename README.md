# roggemanessay

Essay by the named author. This whole website has been turnt into a Markdown file in my current Next.js project. There it's being loaded and pathed to dynamically. The aim originally was to set up a structure like this so that more essays could be loaded from Markdown files without hard coding all of them into the DOM via separate HTML files.
